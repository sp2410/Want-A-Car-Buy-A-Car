The interior has a sleek yet accessible modern look, complemented by shiny angled trim that adds to its edgy feel. Also, the Fusion has been given an assortment of interesting colors, boldly angled front headlights, and exciting new wheel designs. Plus, with engine choices that range from 175 to 240 Horsepower on non-hybrid models, it has the power to add excitement back into your driving. The Fusion comes in 6 trims: the Base S, SE, S Hybrid, Hybrid SE, Titanium, and Hybrid Titanium. The Base S Model includes Ford's SYNC wireless communication system with voice control, 16-inch wheels, an AM FM CD Radio with Auxiliary input and four speakers, tilt steering wheel, and manual climate control. It comes with a 2.5-Liter, 4-Cylinder, Duratec Engine, with 6-Speed Automatic Transmission that gets an EPA estimated 22 MPG City and 34 MPG Hwy. The Hybrid model can drive up to 62 mph on electric power alone, and it also switches between the gas and electric motors. Vehicles equipped with the hybrid engine can achieve a combined EPA 42 MPG. More expensive trims give you features like rear air vents, a rearview camera, Sony Premium Sound System with Satellite Radio, leather seats, and a 1.5L or 2.0L turbocharged engine. Plus, look for optional technology like Intelligent All-Wheel Drive, Active Park Assist, Blind-Spot Monitoring, heated and cooled seats, a Navigation System, and the amazing Lane Keeping System.

Source: Edmunds * Driving the 2014 Ford Focus is incredibly fun and enjoyable. It has a dynamic design, addictive driving experience, and an interior that immerses you into something that is definitely more than just a car. The Focus comes in 7 models to pick from: the Base S Sedan, SE Sedan, SE Hatch, Titanium Sedan, ST, Titanium Hatch, and Electric. New for 2014, there's a Sport Appearance Package for the SE, which has sport cloth seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and an available rear spoiler. Every drop of fuel is effectively used in the Focus with its 2.0L engine. Twin independent variable camshaft timing adds extra precision, contributing to fuel efficiency or power output. The electric power-assisted steering contributes to fuel efficiency as well. Plus, Active Grille Shutters help Focus make itself even more aerodynamic and fuel-efficient. This all helps Focus SE with the SFE Package achieve up to 40 MPG HWY, which equals less stops at the pump. For entertainment, there's SYNC with MyFord Touch, standard on Titanium and Electric trims, and optional on SE and ST. On select models, luxury comes in the form of leather-trimmed seats, dual-zone electronic automatic temperature control, ambient lighting, and 2 Interior Style Packages that feature two-tone leather-trimmed seats, matching door-trim inserts, coordinated steering wheel trim and more. The new Focus ST is geared to get you to your destination quickly. Mash the aluminum accelerator pedal and you'll be treated to the rollicking performance of its 252hp, 2.0L EcoBoost engine that's linked to a 6-speed manual transmission. An overboost feature can sustain increased torque (from 3000 to 4500 rpm) for 15 seconds at a time enhancing its performance feel.

Source: Edmunds * The 2014 Dodge Avenger is classic muscle refined. In front, between large quad halogen headlamps, is Dodge's cross-hair grille with honeycomb texture. It is accompanied on the sides by strong fenders, and bright Ring of Fire LED taillamps in the rear. Its chiseled lines are aerodynamic, yet extremely aggressive. It is available in 3 models, the base SE, SXT, and top-level R/T. The SE and SXT can be purchased with either a peppy 2.4-Liter, 4-Cylinder, 173 horsepower Engine, or an optional 283 Horsepower, 3.6-liter, Pentastar V6. However, the R/T is only available with a V6. The base SE gives you a 4-speed automatic transmission, and if you opt for either of the two higher trims you are treated to a 6-speed automatic for more excitement. The 4-Cylinder engine gets almost the same gas mileage regardless of either transmission choice, but with an EPA estimated 31 MPG Highway, the 6-Speed Automatic is the best performer. The V6 gets an EPA estimated 29 MPG Highway. Inside the Avenger are quality materials, an attractive layout, supportive and comfortable front seats, and soft-touch panels. Steering wheel-mounted controls offer easy access to cruise control and audio settings.

Source: Edmunds * The 2015 Nissan Altima is a car that must be experienced. Its dramatic curves, gorgeously sculpted steel and wide stance adds up to form a car that is exciting to drive, extremely aerodynamic, and slices through the air with ease. Nissan gives you seven tempting Altima trims to choose from starting with the base 2.5 all the way up to the top-of-the-line 3.5 SL. The 2.5 models all share a 2.5-Liter 4-Cylinder engine with 182hp that gets an EPA estimated 27 MPG City and 38 MPG Hwy. The 3.5 Models on the other hand deliver a thrilling 270hp from a more powerful 3.5-Liter V6, and get an EPA estimated 32 MPG highway. All models come standard equipped with the amazing Xtronic CVT transmission. Inside the 2015 Altima, the cabin is spacious, modern and notably upscale with high-end materials and soft lines. For comfort, Nissan developed extremely comfortable front seats that are not only supportive, their cushions also flex in accordance with your pressure points, to help reduce fatigue while driving. Not to be overlooked is the Advanced Drive-Assist Display between the speedometer and tachometer. Depending on the trim level and how your Altima is equipped, the display can show you such things as caller ID, turn-by-turn navigation, low tire pressure alerts, and lane departure warnings directly in front of you reducing the time you have to look away. SV and SL trims have the option of purchasing the available Technology Package. It gives you Lane Departure Warning, Blind Spot Warning and Moving Object Detection, as well as the Nissan Navigation System with voice recognition and a 7-inch touchscreen monitor.

The interior has a sleek yet accessible modern look, complemented by shiny angled trim that adds to its edgy feel. Also, the Fusion has been given an assortment of interesting colors, boldly angled front headlights, and exciting new wheel designs. Plus, with engine choices that range from 175 to 240 Horsepower on non-hybrid models, it has the power to add excitement back into your driving. The Fusion comes in 6 trims: the Base S, SE, S Hybrid, Hybrid SE, Titanium, and Hybrid Titanium. The Base S Model includes Ford's SYNC wireless communication system with voice control, 16-inch wheels, an AM FM CD Radio with Auxiliary input and four speakers, tilt steering wheel, and manual climate control. It comes with a 2.5-Liter, 4-Cylinder, Duratec Engine, with 6-Speed Automatic Transmission that gets an EPA estimated 22 MPG City and 34 MPG Hwy. The Hybrid model can drive up to 62 mph on electric power alone, and it also switches between the gas and electric motors. Vehicles equipped with the hybrid engine can achieve a combined EPA 42 MPG. More expensive trims give you features like rear air vents, a rearview camera, Sony Premium Sound System with Satellite Radio, leather seats, and a 1.5L or 2.0L turbocharged engine. Plus, look for optional technology like Intelligent All-Wheel Drive, Active Park Assist, Blind-Spot Monitoring, heated and cooled seats, a Navigation System, and the amazing Lane Keeping System.

Source: Edmunds * The 2015 Malibu pulled it off in more ways than one. A perfect balance of attractive styling, smart technology and fuel efficiency with EPA est. 36 MPG hwy, all built into a confident driving experience. The enhanced front-end appearance draws you in. Swept-back headlamps aid aerodynamics and a more prominent grille accented in chrome boasts wider openings for improved cooling. Aero-optimized rounded corners, taillamps and side mirrors allow the car to effortlessly slice through the air. Aerodynamic details guide airflow seamlessly around the vehicle body to help increase fuel efficiency by decreasing resistance. The power starts at the heart of the vehicle through the all-new ECOTEC 2.5L four cylinder engine with direct injection and 196hp (LS, LT and LTZ) or opt for the available 259hp turbocharged engine with 295lb.-ft. of torque. It's all the fun without extra fill-ups, thanks to 30 MPG HWY. While maintaining its sophisticated dual-cockpit design, the sport-sculpted seats allow for long-distance comfort. Available Chevrolet MyLink allows you to customize the system to best fit your needs. Make phone calls, select radio stations, choose music from your mobile device and more through voice command, touch-screen, center stack buttons and steering wheel-mounted controls. Take navigation to the next level with on-screen OnStar Navigation. You can step it up another notch with the enhanced Chevrolet MyLink radio with navigation, which includes full navigation features as well as 2-D/3-D maps and points of interest. New for 2015 is the inclusion of an available 4G LTE Wifi connection. This can turn the car into a Wi-Fi hotspot to allow you to stream music, search for restaurants, and stay connected everywhere.

The Mazda6 is the product of engineer and designer working in unison, daring to reimagine the automobile as a whole. It is the true definition of the modern sports sedan. The 2.5L SKYACTIV-G gasoline engine pushes the boundaries of innovation even further. Mazda engineers increased its torque output to 185 lb-ft, all without compromising fuel efficiency. Combine it with the ultra-responsive 6-speed SKYACTIV-MT manual or the smooth 6-speed SKYACTIV-Drive Sport automatic transmission and the result: 184 horsepower and an astounding EPA-estimated 38 MPG hwy (Up to 40 MPG hwy with Grand Touring 2.5L with AT and Technology Package). It all begins when you slide into the luxurious driver's sport seat and fire up with the push button start. With Mazda's newly available Commander Switch, you can control the available navigation system, sound system and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming conveniently from the center console. Other available features include leather trimmed upholstery and heated sports seats. The available fully integrated navigation system with a 7-inch touch-screen display features intuitive voice recognition. Crisp, immersive sound is delivered through an available 11-speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound System with AudioPilot ambient noise compensation technology. With the SKYACTIV-Body, SKYACTIV-Chassis and intuitive safety technologies, Mazda6 is built to protect. Safety features include six standard airbags, should the airbags deploy standard E911 notification uses Bluetooth and your paired phone to call 911 automatically. Available Blind Spot Monitoring uses motion-detecting technology to scan your blind spots.
