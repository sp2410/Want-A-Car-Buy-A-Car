Under the hood sits a powerful 3.6 Liter V6 that produces 285hp and almost as much torque. Combined with the rock-solid Dana front and rear axles, this 5 Speed Automatic transmission will allow you to maintain civility or allow you to carve your own path where ever you see fit thanks to the locking differentials, Rock-Trac HD transfer case and gas charged shocks. This Four Wheel Drive will achieve 21mpg on the highway. The exterior is highlighted with black wheels, tow hooks and a trailer towing package. The Rubicon goes a little beyond basic by offering Air Conditioning, keyless entry, embroidered seats, power windows/locks, and special badging. With city streets and freeways providing an increasingly unfriendly atmosphere to standard, car-based suspensions, large BFGoodrich mud tires and real ground clearance are increasingly handy for the committed urbanite. If you get the urge to take an open-air cruise, just remove the top, put on some shades, crank up the seven Alpine speaker sound system, and hit the road! A strong safety cage surrounds you, multistage airbags protect you, and Hill-start and stability control help you along the way. Our Rubicon offers all of the legendary rock-climbing ability of America's favorite off-roader, with a dose of comfort to go along for the ride!

Stepping in or out of most potholes does nothing more than spill your drink. New for this year is the upgraded interior lighting, making it easier to climb in even on the moonless nights. If you get the urge to take an open-air cruise, just remove the top, put on some shades, crank up the seven Alpine speaker sound system, and hit the road! A secure safety cage surrounds you, multistage airbags protect you, and Hill-start and stability control help you along the way.

Sophisticated electronics help maintain traction and stability over all kinds of uncertain terrain. Power comes via a 4.0-liter version of Nissan's acclaimed VQ V6 used in the 350Z, its fast living Nissan sister.  This Xterra is roomy inside, roomier than other SUVs in its class.

Second-row seating is stadium-style, meaning that the rear passengers can see over the front-seat occupants.\u00C2\u00A0 This is an S trim model, so some extras are on board (in addition to the long list of standard features) including running boards and roof rack cross bars.\u00C2\u00A0\u00C2\u00A0   There is nothing else quite like an Xterra.
